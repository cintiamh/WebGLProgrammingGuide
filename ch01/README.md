# Overview of WebGL

You can use WebGL directly without installing any extra plugins or libraries.
It's all running on modern browsers.

And because WebGL runs on browsers, it's really easy to create and publish your code.
You really need only a simple text editor to make your HTMl and JavaScript files and
then publish normally as you would a simple web page.

WebGL is based on OpenGL, so you can dig deeper by researching the vast documentation
and examples available for OpenGL.

WebGL is specifically based on OpenGL ES (Embedded Systems), which is the version designed
specifically for embedded computers such as smart phones and video game consoles.

Another core part of WebGL are the shaders, referred to as OpenGL ES shading language (GLSL ES).
